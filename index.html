    <li>  <b>Fins:</b>Sharks have different types of fins; hence, they are characterized by dorsal fins (on the back), pectoral fins (on the sides), pelvic fins (on the underside), anal fins (near the tail), and caudal fins (the tail fin).</li>
  Fins allow sharks to control balance and movement and also help them in swimming.
      
     <li> <b>Gills:</b>Sharks have slits on both their sides of heads which are responsible for extracting oxygen from water.Water goes into the shark's mouth and proceeds through the gills, where oxygen is taken-in and carbon dioxide is given off.</li>
     <li> Teeth:Sharks have several rows of teeth with periodic replacement during their lifetime.Their teeth are sharp and serrated, which really help them catching and eating their prey.</li>
      
     <li><b>Skin:</b> The surface of shark skin is covered by small tooth-shaped scales hair-like denticles.The skin denticles of sharks act in two ways: they reduce drag in the water and also provide protection to the shark's skin.</li>
      
    <li> <b>Skeleton:</b> Cartilage is the material that sharks are built from, making their skeletons very light and flexible.It is its cartilaginous skeleton that makes sharks more flexible than fish with bone skeletons and it helps them move easily through the water.</li>

    <li style="margin-top: 2px;">There have been shark fossils found that are as old as 420â€“450 million years old.</li>
    <li style="margin: 2px;">Numerous species with diverse sizes, anatomy, habits, and behaviors have resulted from their evolution.</li>
    <li style="margin: 2px;">
      Each species is classified into a genus and family based on characteristics such as body shape, spine, snout, and fin types. The great white shark, for instance, has two dorsal fins: one huge one around the center of its body and the other behind. Its mouth is located behind its eyes. In contrast, an angel shark has a flat nose with the mouth underneath and a pair of fins in the dorsal region close to the tail.

  </summary>
  Sharks' evolutionary traits have shaped not only how they seem but also how they have adapted to live in the wild. Based on their living environment, which is intimately linked to the structure and functions of their bodies, sharks can be divided into three categories. There are three types of sharks in the ocean: those that live at the surface and move slowly, those that are in the pelagic zone and can swim incredibly well, and those that stay near the seafloor, or benthic zone, and move slowly in quest of food.

    <li>Whale sharks: The largest fish species is the whale shark, which weighs an average of 20.6 metric tons (45,000 pounds). The largest people have a maximum weight of 34 metric tons, or 75,000 pounds.</li>
    <li>Great White Shark: Female great white sharks are larger than males, and adult sharks typically weigh between 680 and 1,800 kilograms (1,500 and 4,000 pounds).

    </li>
    <li>Tiger Shark: Female tiger sharks are larger than male tiger sharks, with an average weight of 385 to 635 kilograms (850 to 1,400 pounds).</li>

  <ul  style="font-size: large;">
    <li>Sharks can be found all across the planet, from cold oceans to balmy, tropical lagoons. Some even live in rivers and freshwater lakes!</li>
    <li>Sharks swim with less energy because of their fusiform body shape, which is spherical and tapering at both ends.</li>
    <li>Sharks consume much less food than most people realize. Compared to warm-blooded creatures, cold-blooded animals have a substantially slower metabolism. In actuality, a shark in a zoological setting consumes between 1 and 10% of its body weight every week. Analyses conducted on wild sharks reveal comparable dietary habits.
</li>
    <li>Out of around 350 shark species, only 32 have ever been reported to attack humans. Like most natural creatures, sharks prefer to stay away from humans. Shark attacks are likely the result of their mistaking humans for food or defending their territory. </li>
    <li>Sharks frequently lose teeth, especially during feeding, and unlike bony fish, their teeth are not fixed in their jaws. Because sharks have three or more rows of teeth, a lost tooth is promptly replaced by another. A single shark's teeth can total up to 30,000 during its lifetime.</li>

          As of the latest data available, the estimated global population of sharks is approximately [insert estimated number here]. However, it's important to note that this figure is just an approximation and can vary significantly by species and region. Counting shark populations accurately presents a considerable challenge due to various factors such as their wide-ranging migration patterns, diverse habitats, and the elusive nature of many species.
          
          Sharks inhabit a wide range of marine environments, from shallow coastal waters to the depths of the open ocean, making them difficult to survey comprehensively. <br> <br>Furthermore, many shark species exhibit migratory behavior, moving across vast distances in response to changes in temperature, prey availability, and other environmental factors. This mobility adds complexity to population assessments as sharks may not remain in one location long enough to be accurately counted.
          
          Additionally, the vastness of the ocean and the limited accessibility of certain regions pose logistical challenges to researchers attempting to study and quantify shark populations. Traditional survey methods such as visual sightings, tagging, and acoustic monitoring have their limitations, particularly in deep-sea habitats where sharks are less frequently encountered.</p>

          <h2 style="color: black;font-size: xx-large;">Conservation Efforts</h2>
      <p>Amidst threats like overfishing, habitat loss, and climate change, dedicated global efforts prioritize the conservation of sharks. Strategies encompass a range of initiatives, including the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs) to safeguard vital habitats and mitigate exploitation pressures. Sustainable fishing practices, such as catch limits and shark finning bans, help prevent population declines while ensuring fisheries' sustainability. Additionally, educational outreach programs play a crucial role in raising awareness about shark conservation, dispelling myths, and fostering empathy towards these apex predators. <br><br>By engaging communities and stakeholders worldwide, these efforts promote a culture of stewardship and inspire action to protect sharks and marine ecosystems. International collaboration further strengthens conservation endeavors, facilitating knowledge exchange, resource sharing, and coordinated action across borders. Through collective dedication and cooperation, we can mitigate threats to shark populations and ensure their continued presence, preserving the balance and biodiversity of our oceans for generations to come.</p>

      <h2 style="color: black;font-size: xx-large;">Get Involved</h2>
      <p>Supporting organizations and initiatives dedicated to shark conservation is vital in ensuring the preservation of marine life. By backing these efforts financially or through volunteer work, individuals contribute directly to research, habitat protection, and policy advocacy aimed at safeguarding shark populations. Advocating for sustainable seafood choices is another impactful way to make a difference. By opting for sustainably sourced seafood and encouraging others to do the same, consumers reduce the demand for products that contribute to overfishing and habitat destruction. Additionally, spreading awareness about the importance of preserving our oceans and the role sharks play in maintaining marine ecosystems is essential. <br><br>Through education and outreach, individuals can dispel misconceptions about sharks, inspire empathy for these misunderstood creatures, and rally support for conservation initiatives. By taking collective action to support shark conservation, we can help ensure a brighter future for sharks and the marine ecosystems they inhabit, preserving their ecological significance for generations to come..</p>

  var txt = 'Sharks, the large group of fish, were already existing in oceans over 400 million years ago, even before the dinosaurs appeared on our planet. They are members of the Selachimorpha superorder and modern sharks have some qualities in common like cartilage skeleton, five or six gill pairs and multiple rows of teeth.The nearest living relative of the ancient Sharks existed before land vertebrates took over the world. The plants had not yet grown on continents. Though they looked like nothing of todays variety, sharks are one of the oldest creatures that have lived here.Since the shark species as we know it now has existed for 100 million years, it means that during the time that dinosaurs roamed the land, they were living in the oceans. With an anatomy that has only become better over those million years of evolution, this record-breaking survival is nothing short of astounding.Human emotions evoked by these unusual creatures include fear, wonder, curiosity, respect, and love. The major reason they elicit such a wide range of sentiments is because they are portrayed in popular culture as vicious predators. The reality, though, is somewhat different. Sharks are intriguing and complicated animals that are not often portrayed in the media. Further, a great deal of animals are benign and submissive.';
